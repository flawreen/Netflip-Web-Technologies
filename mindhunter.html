		<h3>Series info</h3>
		<section>
			<p>Catching a criminal often requires the authorities to get inside the villain's mind to figure out how he
				thinks. That's the job of FBI agents Holden Ford and Bill Tench. They attempt to understand and catch
				serial
				killers by studying their damaged psyches. Along the way, the agents pioneer the development of modern
				serial-killer profiling. The crime drama has a strong pedigree behind the camera, with Oscar-nominated
				director David Fincher and Oscar-winning actress Charlize Theron among the show's executive
				producers.</p>

		<h3>Critic review</h3>
		<section>
			<p>
				The soul-crushing dread that comes from looking into an abyss and realizing that you may never
				comprehend
				its nature is vividly felt in the performances of [Jonathan] Groff, [Anna] Torv and especially [Holt]
				McCallany.
				- Nick Schager
