		<h3>Movie info</h3>
		<p>Actor Rick Dalton gained fame and fortune by starring in a 1950s television Western, but is now
			struggling to find meaningful work in a Hollywood that he doesn't recognize anymore. He spends most of
			his time drinking and palling around with Cliff Booth, his easygoing best friend and longtime stunt
			double. Rick also happens to live next door to Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate -- the filmmaker and
			budding actress whose futures will forever be altered by members of the Manson Family.</p>

		<h3>Critic review</h3>
		<p>
			Take to heart the legendary director’s underlining commentary on the audience’s insatiable appetite and
			craving for the macabre, which seems to be the point entirely.
			- M.N. Miller
