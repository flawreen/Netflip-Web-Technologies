		<h3>Series info</h3>
		<p>In addition to her role as creator and executive producer of this mind-bending series, Brit Marling also
			plays the role of Prairie Johnson, a young woman who returns home after a 7-year disappearance. Her sudden
			return is not the only miraculous occurrence: everyone is shocked to learn that Prairie is no longer blind.
			While the FBI and her parents are anxious to discuss Prairie's disappearance, she won't talk about what
			happened during the time that she was missing. Zal Batmanglij, the co-creator and an executive producer of
			the series, is the director of every episode.</p>

		<h3>Critic review</h3>
		<p>
			The second season continues to blur genres, jump into surprise directions, and thrill in its visual palette,
			but an air of pretension, and the occasional baffling moment, holds the show back from entirely resonating
			on an emotional level.
			- Adam Starkey
